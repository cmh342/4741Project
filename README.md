Predicting Company Bankruptcy

cmh342, md794

Our project aims to predict whether or not a company will go bankrupt. Predictions of bankruptcy are crucial to the financial industry to make better credit and
loan assessments. These predictions can have huge impacts on the rest of the world -- from the business owners and financial industry to the rest of the society.
Being able to accurately and efficiently predict bankruptcies has immense value, and the dataset that we are working with can give us valuable insight into
which factors play key roles in influencing the markets and the financial industry as a whole.
